#### What was new to me
> I filled all gaps in knowledge of git and github. Also I's discovered and learned some git features such as `rebase`, `merge`.     
#### What surprised me
> `cherry-pick` really surprised me. I never knew I can create new branch with the best commits of projects. Also I was pleasantly surprised when I saw commands looks like:
```
git checkout master^
git checkout HEAD~3
```
> I didn't know I can do it. 
#### What I intend to use in the future
> I'm going to use git, because it's a very powerful tool. Finally, I made friends (branch, rebase..). Before now I had problems using git, I never used and created branches, README. But now I understand git and easily use it. :blush:
